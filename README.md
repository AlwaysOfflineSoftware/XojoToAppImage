## How to Use
Download the app image or archive (unzip the archive) and then run,r learn how to build it yourself below.
Then place the path of the main Xojo executable in the executable field and the icon path in the icon field and hit the run button. Instantly and appimage should be generated!


## How to Build
Made with <a href="https://www.xojo.com">Xojo</a> (Which is free for Linux!)
Once you have the IDE downloaded, open the project and you will need to add the dependancies to the asset folder in the editor, these are all included in the repo, it should look something like this:

run the program via the IDE to make sure any issues are resolved and then hit build in the IDE if everything clears. Done!
